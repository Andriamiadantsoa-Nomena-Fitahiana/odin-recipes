    <p>This delicious stuffed eggplant with a cheesy top is a must-try recipe! 
        Great as a hearty main but you can buy the mini eggplants and use them for
         a side dish or appetizer.</p>
    <h2>Stuffed Eggplant Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggplant: You’ll need one eggplant (halved lengthwise) to make two servings. </li>
        <li>Olive oil: Brush the shells with olive oil before seasoning with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Seasonings: This stuffed eggplant is seasoned with salt, pepper, fresh garlic, and fresh basil. </li>
        <li>Sausage: Sweet Italian sausage makes this stuffed eggplant a hearty, crowd-pleasing meal. </li>
        <li>Vegetables: An onion and fresh mushrooms lend texture and flavor. </li>
        <li>Pasta sauce: Use store-bought or homemade tomato-basil pasta sauce.</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs: Italian-seasoned panko bread crumbs give the stuffed eggplant a welcome crunch. </li>
        <li>Cheese: For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmesan cheese instead of using the pre-shredded stuff. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Let's cook it</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Scoop out the flesh, brush the shells with oil, and season.</li>
        <li>Chop the reserved eggplant flesh into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, vegetables, and garlic in the remaining oil. </li>
        <li>Stir in the reserved eggplant, basil, and sauce. Mix in some of the panko and cheese.</li>
        <li>Stuff the shells and sprinkle the remaining cheese and panko over the top. </li>
        <li>Bake until the eggplant is tender. </li>
